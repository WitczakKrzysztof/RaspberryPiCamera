# RaspberryPiCamera

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi, a camera module, and establishes a connection to a PC using UART protocol. The aim of this project is to enable the Raspberry Pi to capture images or videos using the camera module and transmit them to a PC via UART communication.

The Raspberry Pi, a versatile single-board computer, serves as the core of the project. It provides the necessary processing power and GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins to interface with the camera module. The camera module, compatible with the Raspberry Pi, allows for high-quality image and video capture.

To establish the connection between the Raspberry Pi and the PC, UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) protocol is utilized. UART is a simple, asynchronous serial communication protocol commonly used for inter-device communication. By employing UART, the Raspberry Pi can transmit data in a serial format to the PC, facilitating seamless data transfer.
